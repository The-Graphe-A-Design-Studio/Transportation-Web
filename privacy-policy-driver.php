<li>USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>o Our primary goal in collecting your information is to provide you with an enhanced experience when using the Services. We use your information to closely monitor which features of the Services are used most, to allow you to view your trip history, rate trips, and to determine which features we need to focus on improving, including usage patterns and geographic locations to determine where we should offer or focus services, features and/or resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>o Based upon the Protected Information you provide us when registering for an account, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>o We use the information collected from our Mobile Application so that we are able to serve you the correct app version depending on your device type, for troubleshooting and in some cases, marketing purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>o We use your Internet Protocol (IP) address to help diagnose problems with our computer server and to administer our website (s). Your IP address is used to help identify you but contains no personal information about you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>o We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our Services are temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might email you. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>o We may use the information obtained from you to prevent, discover, and investigate violations of this Privacy Policy or any applicable terms of service or terms of use for the Mobile Application, and to investigate fraud, chargeback or other matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>o We provide some of your Protected Information (such as your name, pick up address, contact number) to the driver who accepts your request for transportation so that the driver may contact and find you. The companies for which drivers work (that are providing the transportation service) are also able to access your Protected Information, including your geo-location data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>o We also provide your information to the other users who shall be travelling with you in the vehicle assigned to you, should you choose any pooled vehicle feature of our Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>o We use that geo-location information for various purposes, including for you to be able to view the drivers in your area that are close to your location, for you to set your pickup location, for the drivers to identify the pickup location, to send you promotions and offers, and to allow you (if you choose through any features we may provide) to share this information with other people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>o In addition, we may use your Protected Information or Usage Information that we collect about you: (1) to provide you with information or services or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive including to send you electronic newsletters, or to provide you with special offers or promotional materials on behalf of us or third parties; (2) to enable you to participate in a variety of the Service&rsquo;s features such as online or mobile entry sweepstakes, contests or other promotions; (3) to contact you with regard to your use of the Services and, at our discretion, changes to the Services and/or the Services&rsquo; policies; (4) for internal business purposes; (5) for inclusion in our data analytics; and (6) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>o We may share the information collected from you with TFS if you choose to avail of any transportation services offered by TFS on the Mobile Application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>o We may use the information collected from you for targeted advertising. This involves using information collected on an individual's web or mobile browsing behaviour such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is then used to select which advertisements should be displayed to a particular individual on websites other than our website(s). The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number.</p>

</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>THIRD-PARTY CONTENT AND LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICES.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Services may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect website usage information and your Device Identifier when web pages from any online or mobile Services are served to your browser. In addition, when you are using the Services, you may be directed to other sites or applications that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any of these third parties. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, the click may take you away from one of our websites onto a different website. These other websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit Protected Information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. We encourage you to note when you leave our Services and to read the privacy statements of all third-party websites or applications before submitting any Protected Information to third parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a7. INFORMATION COLLECTED BY DRIVERS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy shall not cover the usage of any information about you which is obtained by the driver or the company to which the driver belongs while providing you with a ride on a cab booked using the Services, or otherwise, which is not provided by us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>CHANGE OF INFORMATION AND CANCELLATION OF ACCOUNT</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of account registration. If your Protected Information changes, or if you no longer desire our Services, you may correct, delete inaccuracies, or amend information by making the change on our member information page or by contacting us through the email address mentioned on our website or Mobile Application. We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then-active databases as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) You may also cancel or modify the communications that you have elected to receive from the Services by following the instructions contained within an e-mail or by logging into your user account and changing your communication preferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) If upon modifying or changing the information earlier provided to us, we find it difficult to permit access to our Services to you due to insufficiency/ inaccuracy of the information, we may, in our sole discretion terminate your access to the services by providing you with a written notice to this effect on your registered email ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, contact us through the email address mentioned on the trip bill received. We will retain your Protected Information and Usage Information (including geo-location) for as long as your account with the Services is active and as needed to provide your services. Even after your account is terminated, we will retain your Protected Information and Usage Information (including geo-location, trip history, and transaction history) as needed to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, resolve disputes, conclude any activities related to the cancellation of an account, investigate or prevent fraud and other inappropriate activity, to enforce our agreements, and for other business reason.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>SECURITY</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Protected Information and Usage Information we collect is securely stored within our databases, and we use standard, industry-wide, commercially reasonable security practices such as encryption, firewalls, and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) for protecting your information. However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet or wireless communication, and any information you transmit to the Company you do at your own risk. We recommend that you not disclose your password to anyone.</p>
